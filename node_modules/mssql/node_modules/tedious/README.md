Tedious (node implementation of TDS)
====================================
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/pekim/tedious.png)](http://travis-ci.org/pekim/tedious)

Tedious is an implementation of the [TDS protocol](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd304523.aspx),
which is used to interact with instances of Microsoft's SQL Server.

It is intended to be a fairly slim implementation of the protocol, with not too much additional functionality.

Name
----
_Tedious_ is simply derived from a fast, slightly garbled, pronunciation of the letters T, D and S. 

Status

Coming soon

- full decoding of collation data
- ability to cancel a request
